# Fraud_Detection_AWS_SageMaker
This project is a fraud detection system that encorporates the use of XGBoost on credit card transactions to detect fraudulent ones. The Machine Learning algorithm has been developed and deployed using Amazon SageMaker. 

<!-----------------------> 


Steps: 

- Downloading the dataset from the internet into Amazon SageMaker.  

*Dataset*: (credit-card-transactions dataset): https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-e2e-solutions/fraud-detection/creditcardfraud.zip
## Note: The data is already normalized and standardized. 

- Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed into Amazon SageMaker Algorithms. 


- Estimating a model using the Gradient Boosted algorithm. 



- Evaluating the effectiveness of the model. 


- Setting up the model to make on-going predictions.
